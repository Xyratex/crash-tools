Designed to be built stand alone for crash version crash-4.0-4.1.  The 
included defs.h file will likely work for similar versions of crash but
if your building for a different release best to compile using that defs.h.
Alternately you can add the lustre.c file to the 'extensions' directory
when building crash and simply add it to the makefile.

Build as follows:

  make

  ...or if you prefer...

  gcc -nostartfiles -shared -rdynamic -o lustre.so lustre.c -fPIC -D<arch>

Example usage:

  # Launch crash against a crash dump or live kernel to extract
  # and re-assemble the binary lustre debug log.
  > crash <your kernel crash dump> <your vmlinux>
    ...
    crash> mod -S
      ...
    crash> extend lustre.so
      lustre.so: shared object loaded
    crash> lustre -l /tmp/foo.dl
      lustre: Dumped 2560 debug pages from CPU 0
      lustre: Dumped 2560 debug pages from CPU 1
      lustre: Dumped 2560 debug pages from CPU 2
      lustre: Dumped 2560 debug pages from CPU 3
      lustre: Dumped 2560 debug pages from CPU 4
      lustre: Dumped 2560 debug pages from CPU 5
      lustre: Dumped 2560 debug pages from CPU 6
      lustre: Dumped 2560 debug pages from CPU 7
      lustre: Dumped 20480 total debug pages from 8 CPUs to /tmp/foo.dl
    crash> quit

  # Convert the binary debug log to a text debug log
  > /usr/sbin/lctl df /tmp/foo.dl >/tmp/foo.dk

  # View your debug log
  > vim /tmp/foo.dk
